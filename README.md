# AIM.Simulation

AIM.Simulation is a part of the [Assembly Information Modeling](https://github.com/ALharchi/AIM.Core) toolkit. It is a set of Grasshopper components that allow quick rigid body simulation for testing assembly sequences and joints.

The engine behind the simulation is the open source real-time physics engine [NVIDIA PhysX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX). The C# wrapper is from [stilldesign/PhysX.Net](https://github.com/stilldesign/PhysX.Net). Most of the Grasshopper implementation is forked from [PhysX.GH](https://github.com/TheAsianCoders/PhysX.GH) by Gene Ting-Chun Kao, Long Nguyen and The Asian Coders.

## Requirements

 - Rhinoceros 3D 6
 - Windows 10 - 64 bits

## Installation

Download the latest release. Unzip it and copy the contents to your Grasshoper Libraries folder. Usually it is something like this:

    C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries

## Usage
Check the Example folder for some example files.
